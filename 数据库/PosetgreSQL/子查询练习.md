# 子查询练习

巩固子查询

## 1. 查询和 `'Zlotkey'` 相同部门的员工姓名和工资

```sql
-- WHERE子查询
SELECT last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id
                        FROM employees
                        WHERE last_name = 'Zlotkey');
-- FROM子查询
SELECT last_name, salary
FROM employees
    JOIN (SELECT department_id
                        FROM employees
                        WHERE last_name = 'Zlotkey') AS ZL
        ON employees.department_id = ZL.department_id;
```

> [!tip]
>  需要注意 `WHERE` 子查询中，如果有多人名叫 `Zlotkey` 可能导致 `=` 运算符失效。建议替换为 `IN`

## 2. 查询工资比公司平均工资高的员工的员工号，姓名和工资

```sql
SELECT employee_id, last_name, salary  
FROM employees  
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) 
				FROM employees);
```

## 3. 选择工资大于所有 `JOB_ID = 'SA_MAN'` 的员工的工资的员工的 `last_name`, `job_id`, `salary`

```sql
SELECT emp.last_name, emp.job_id, emp.salary
FROM employees AS emp
WHERE salary > ALL(SELECT salary FROM employees WHERE job_id = 'SA_MAN');
```

## 4. 查询和姓名中包含字母 `u` 的员工在相同部门的员工的员工号和姓名

```sql
SELECT emp.employee_id, emp.last_name
FROM employees AS emp
WHERE department_id in (
                        SELECT DISTINCT department_id
                        FROM employees
                        WHERE last_name like '%u%'
                        ) ;
```

## 5. 查询在部门的 `location_id` 为 `1700` 的部门工作的员工的员工号

```sql
-- 子查询
SELECT emp.employee_id
FROM employees AS emp
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id
                        FROM departments
                        WHERE location_id = 1700);
-- 连接查询
SELECT emp.employee_id
FROM employees AS emp
    JOIN departments AS dep
        ON emp.department_id = dep.department_id
WHERE dep.location_id = 1700
```

## 6. 查询管理者是 `King` 的员工姓名和工资

```sql
-- 子查询
SELECT emp.last_name, emp.salary
FROM employees AS emp
WHERE manager_id IN (SELECT employee_id
                    FROM employees AS manger
                    WHERE manger.last_name = 'King');
-- 连接查询(自连接)
SELECT emp.last_name, emp.salary
FROM employees AS emp
    JOIN employees AS manager
        ON manager.employee_id = emp.manager_id
WHERE manager.last_name = 'King';

-- EXISTS
SELECT emp.last_name, emp.salary
FROM employees AS emp
WHERE EXISTS(SELECT *
             FROM employees as manager
             WHERE manager.employee_id = emp.manager_id AND manager.last_name = 'King');
```

## 7. 查询工资最低的员工信息: last_name, salary

```sql
SELECT last_name, salary  
FROM employees  
WHERE salary = (SELECT MIN(salary)  
                FROM employees);
```

## 8. 查询平均工资最低的部门信息

```sql
-- 查询每个部门的平均工资
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS dep_avg
FROM employees
group by department_id;
-- 找到部门最小的平均值
SELECT MIN(dep_avg_sal)
FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS dep_avg_sal
      FROM employees
      group by department_id) AS dep_avg_sal_tabel;
-- 平均工资最小的部门
SELECT department_id
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) = (SELECT MIN(dep_avg_sal)
                      FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS dep_avg_sal
                            FROM employees
                            group by department_id) AS dep_avg_sal_tabel);
-- 使用部门ID 取部门信息
SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id
                       FROM employees
                       GROUP BY department_id
                       HAVING AVG(salary) = (SELECT MIN(dep_avg_sal)
                                             FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS dep_avg_sal
                                                   FROM employees
                                                   group by department_id) AS dep_avg_sal_tabel));
```

优化上述的 `SELECT`

```sql
-- 使用 ALL 减少一层 SELECT
SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id
                       FROM employees
                       GROUP BY department_id
                       HAVING AVG(salary) <= ALL (SELECT AVG(salary)
                                                   FROM employees
                                                   group by department_id));
                                                   
-- ORDER BY + LIMIT 将子查询嵌套减少一层
SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id
                       FROM employees
                       GROUP BY department_id
                       HAVING AVG(salary) = (SELECT AVG(salary)
                                             FROM employees
                                             group by department_id
                                             ORDER BY AVG(salary)
                                             LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0));

-- ORDER BY + LIMIT + 连接查询，将子查询嵌套减少到一层
SELECT dep.*
FROM departments AS dep,
     (SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS dep_avg
      FROM employees
      group by department_id
      ORDER BY dep_avg
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0) AS dep_avg_sal_table
WHERE dep.department_id = dep_avg_sal_table.department_id
```

## 9. 查询平均工资最低的部门信息和该部门的平均工资

              group by department_id) AS dep_avg_sal_tabel) AS min_dep_sal
FROM departments AS dep
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id
                       FROM employees
                       GROUP BY department_id
                       HAVING AVG(salary) = (SELECT MIN(dep_avg_sal)
                                             FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) AS dep_avg_sal
                                                   FROM employees
                                                   group by department_id) AS dep_avg_sal_tabel));

SELECT dep.*, (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees AS e WHERE e.department_id = dep.department_id) AS min_dep_sal
FROM departments AS dep
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id

SELECT dep.*, dep_avg
FROM departments AS dep,
     (SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS dep_avg
      FROM employees
      group by department_id
      ORDER BY dep_avg
      LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0) AS dep_avg_sal_table
WHERE dep.department_id = dep_avg_sal_table.department_id;
